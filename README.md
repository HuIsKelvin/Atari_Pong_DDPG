# Atari_Pong_DDPG
There are three algorithms in my code for OpenAI Atari Game Pong
You can check the main agent algorithms in the directory 'algos' with DQN, DDPG and PPO.
But only the DQN seem work finally, DDPG and PPO can not train the agent efficiently.

# If you could find some problems in my DDPG and PPO algorithms, please contact me!

# Thank you for your sincerely help.
